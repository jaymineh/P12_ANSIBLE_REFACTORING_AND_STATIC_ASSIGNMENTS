# Project 12 - Ansible Refactoring And Static Assignments (Imports And Roles)

In this project, I built on the previous project by implementing ansible refactoring to optimize the code. Refactoring simply means making changes to the source code without changing expected behavior of the software. Imports allow for effective ru-use of previously created playbooks in a new playbook leading to better organization of tasks and reuse when needed. 

Kindly check `project.md` for more information.
